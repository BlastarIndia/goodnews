<p>Your favorite subscription only provides a teaser and not the full text?
    The linked website is overloaded and it is hard to find the content?
    Then you should enable the <em>Readability</em> mobilizer in the <em>news reading</em> settings.</p>

<p>Further on GoodNews supports offline reading, which enables you to read your articles (including images),
    even if there is no internet connection available.
    Read the <a href="http://www.goodnews-mobile.com/doc/how-to/offline-reading/">relevant how to article</a> to learn
    about all the related settings.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> You can also override the global mobilizer and offline reading setting on a per subscription
    basis.</p>
