<p>GoodNews is extremely customizable. So whenever something isn't solved in the way you would like to see it,
    you should take a look into the settings.</p>

<p>In each view's menu you will find two setting entries:</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Settings:</dt>
    <dd>These are the global settings broken down into categories like <em>News Reading</em> and <em>Storage</em>.
        They are the same no matter from which view you have called them.
    </dd>
    <dt>View Settings:</dt>
    <dd>These are the settings which are specific to the current view.
        (you will also find them in the <em>User Interface</em> section of the global settings)
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>Further on there are item specific options for labels and subscriptions available: Tap and hold such an item and
    select the <em>Settings</em> entry from it's context menu.</p>
